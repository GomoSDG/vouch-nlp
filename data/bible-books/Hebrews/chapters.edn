[{:text "Jesus Is Greater Than Moses\n\n3 And so, dear brothers and sisters who belong to God and[a] are partners with those called to heaven, think carefully about this Jesus whom we declare to be God’s messenger[b] and High Priest. 2 For he was faithful to God, who appointed him, just as Moses served faithfully when he was entrusted with God’s entire[c] house.\n\n3 But Jesus deserves far more glory than Moses, just as a person who builds a house deserves more praise than the house itself. 4 For every house has a builder, but the one who built everything is God.\n\n5 Moses was certainly faithful in God’s house as a servant. His work was an illustration of the truths God would reveal later. 6 But Christ, as the Son, is in charge of God’s entire house. And we are God’s house, if we keep our courage and remain confident in our hope in Christ.[d]\n\n7 That is why the Holy Spirit says,\n\n“Today when you hear his voice,\n\n8 \n    don’t harden your hearts\nas Israel did when they rebelled,\n    when they tested me in the wilderness.\n\n9 \nThere your ancestors tested and tried my patience,\n    even though they saw my miracles for forty years.\n\n10 \nSo I was angry with them, and I said,\n‘Their hearts always turn away from me.\n    They refuse to do what I tell them.’\n\n11 \nSo in my anger I took an oath:\n    ‘They will never enter my place of rest.’”[e]\n\n12 Be careful then, dear brothers and sisters.[f] Make sure that your own hearts are not evil and unbelieving, turning you away from the living God. 13 You must warn each other every day, while it is still “today,” so that none of you will be deceived by sin and hardened against God. 14 For if we are faithful to the end, trusting God just as firmly as when we first believed, we will share in all that belongs to Christ. 15 Remember what it says:\n\n“Today when you hear his voice,\n    don’t harden your hearts\n    as Israel did when they rebelled.”[g]\n\n16 And who was it who rebelled against God, even though they heard his voice? Wasn’t it the people Moses led out of Egypt? 17 And who made God angry for forty years? Wasn’t it the people who sinned, whose corpses lay in the wilderness? 18 And to whom was God speaking when he took an oath that they would never enter his rest? Wasn’t it the people who disobeyed him? 19 So we see that because of their unbelief they were not able to enter his rest.\n\nFootnotes\n3:1a Greek And so, holy brothers who.\n3:1b Greek God’s apostle.\n3:2 Some manuscripts do not include entire.\n3:6 Some manuscripts add faithful to the end.\n3:7-11 Ps 95:7-11.\n3:12 Greek brothers.\n3:15 Ps 95:7-8.", :number "3", :title "Hebrews 3", :translation "NLT", :book "Hebrews"} {:text "5 Every high priest is a man chosen to represent other people in their dealings with God.

He must be called by God for this work, just as Aaron was. 5 That is why Christ did not honor himself by assuming he could become High Priest. No, he was chosen by God, who said to him,\n\n“You are my Son.\n    Today I have become your Father.[a]”\n\n6 And in another passage God said to him,\n\n“You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.”[b]\n\n7 While Jesus was here on earth, he offered prayers and pleadings, with a loud cry and tears, to the one who could rescue him from death.

When he had cleansed us from our sins, he sat down in the place of honor at the right hand of the majestic God in heaven. 4 This shows that the Son is far greater than the angels, just as the name God gave him is greater than their names.\n\nThe Son Is Greater Than the Angels\n\n5 For God never said to any angel what he said to Jesus:\n\n“You are my Son.\n    Today I have become your Father.[a]”\n\nGod also said,\n\n“I will be his Father,\n    and he will be my Son.”[b]\n\n6 And when he brought his supreme[c] Son into the world, God said,[d]\n\n“Let all of God’s angels worship him.”[e]\n\n7 Regarding the angels, he says,\n\n“He sends his angels like the winds,\n    his servants like flames of fire.”[f]\n\n8 But to the Son he says,\n\n“Your throne, O God, endures forever and ever.\n    You rule with a scepter of justice.\n\n9 \nYou love justice and hate evil.\n    Therefore, O God, your God has anointed you,\n    pouring out the oil of joy on you more than on anyone else.”[g]\n\n10 He also says to the Son,\n\n“In the beginning, Lord, you laid the foundation of the earth\n    and made the heavens with your hands.\n\n11 \nThey will perish, but you remain forever.\n    They will wear out like old clothing.\n\n12 \nYou will fold them up like a cloak\n    and discard them like old clothing.\nBut you are always the same;\n    you will live forever.”[h]\n\n13 And God never said to any of the angels,\n\n“Sit in the place of honor at my right hand\n    until I humble your enemies,\n    making them a footstool under your feet.”[i]\n\n14 Therefore, angels are only servants—spirits sent to care for people who will inherit salvation.\n\nFootnotes\n1:5a Or Today I reveal you as my Son.

Abel’s offering gave evidence that he was a righteous man, and God showed his approval of his gifts. Although Abel is long dead, he still speaks to us by his example of faith.\n\n5 It was by faith that Enoch was taken up to heaven without dying—“he disappeared, because God took him.”[a] For before he was taken up, he was known as a person who pleased God. 6 And it is impossible to please God without faith. Anyone who wants to come to him must believe that God exists and that he rewards those who sincerely seek him.\n\n7 It was by faith that Noah built a large boat to save his family from the flood. He obeyed God, who warned him about things that had never happened before. By his faith Noah condemned the rest of the world, and he received the righteousness that comes by faith.\n\n8 It was by faith that Abraham obeyed when God called him to leave home and go to another land that God would give him as his inheritance. He went without knowing where he was going. 9 And even when he reached the land God promised him, he lived there by faith—for he was like a foreigner, living in tents. And so did Isaac and Jacob, who inherited the same promise. 10 Abraham was confidently looking forward to a city with eternal foundations, a city designed and built by God.\n\n11 It was by faith that even Sarah was able to have a child, though she was barren and was too old. She believed[b] that God would keep his promise. 12 And so a whole nation came from this one man who was as good as dead—a nation with so many people that, like the stars in the sky and the sand on the seashore, there is no way to count them.\n\n13 All these people died still believing what God had promised them. They did not receive what was promised, but they saw it all from a distance and welcomed it. They agreed that they were foreigners and nomads here on earth. 14 Obviously people who say such things are looking forward to a country they can call their own. 15 If they had longed for the country they came from, they could have gone back. 16 But they were looking for a better place, a heavenly homeland. That is why God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.\n\n17 It was by faith that Abraham offered Isaac as a sacrifice when God was testing him. Abraham, who had received God’s promises, was ready to sacrifice his only son, Isaac, 18 even though God had told him, “Isaac is the son through whom your descendants will be counted.”[c] 19 Abraham reasoned that if Isaac died, God was able to bring him back to life again.

He even commanded them to take his bones with them when they left.\n\n23 It was by faith that Moses’ parents hid him for three months when he was born.

He kept right on going because he kept his eyes on the one who is invisible. 28 It was by faith that Moses commanded the people of Israel to keep the Passover and to sprinkle blood on the doorposts so that the angel of death would not kill their firstborn sons.\n\n29 It was by faith that the people of Israel went right through the Red Sea as though they were on dry ground.

Who ever heard of a child who is never disciplined by its father? 8 If God doesn’t discipline you as he does all of his children, it means that you are illegitimate and are not really his children at all. 9 Since we respected our earthly fathers who disciplined us, shouldn’t we submit even more to the discipline of the Father of our spirits, and live forever?[g]\n\n10 For our earthly fathers disciplined us for a few years, doing the best they knew how. But God’s discipline is always good for us, so that we might share in his holiness. 11 No discipline is enjoyable while it is happening—it’s painful! But afterward there will be a peaceful harvest of right living for those who are trained in this way.\n\n12 So take a new grip with your tired hands and strengthen your weak knees. 13 Mark out a straight path for your feet so that those who are weak and lame will not fall but become strong.\n\nA Call to Listen to God\n\n14 Work at living in peace with everyone, and work at living a holy life, for those who are not holy will not see the Lord. 15 Look after each other so that none of you fails to receive the grace of God. Watch out that no poisonous root of bitterness grows up to trouble you, corrupting many. 16 Make sure that no one is immoral or godless like Esau, who traded his birthright as the firstborn son for a single meal. 17 You know that afterward, when he wanted his father’s blessing, he was rejected. It was too late for repentance, even though he begged with bitter tears.\n\n18 You have not come to a physical mountain,[h] to a place of flaming fire, darkness, gloom, and whirlwind, as the Israelites did at Mount Sinai. 19 For they heard an awesome trumpet blast and a voice so terrible that they begged God to stop speaking. 20 They staggered back under God’s command: “If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned to death.”[i] 21 Moses himself was so frightened at the sight that he said, “I am terrified and trembling.”[j]\n\n22 No, you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to countless thousands of angels in a joyful gathering. 23 You have come to the assembly of God’s firstborn children, whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God himself, who is the judge over all things. You have come to the spirits of the righteous ones in heaven who have now been made perfect. 24 You have come to Jesus, the one who mediates the new covenant between God and people, and to the sprinkled blood, which speaks of forgiveness instead of crying out for vengeance like the blood of Abel.\n\n25 Be careful that you do not refuse to listen to the One who is speaking. For if the people of Israel did not escape when they refused to listen to Moses, the earthly messenger, we will certainly not escape if we reject the One who speaks to us from heaven! 26 When God spoke from Mount Sinai his voice shook the earth, but now he makes another promise: “Once again I will shake not only the earth but the heavens also.”[k] 27 This means that all of creation will be shaken and removed, so that only unshakable things will remain.\n\n28 Since we are receiving a Kingdom that is unshakable, let us be thankful and please God by worshiping him with holy fear and awe. 29 For our God is a devouring fire.\n\nFootnotes\n12:2a Or Jesus, the originator and perfecter of our faith.\n12:2b Or Instead of the joy.\n12:3 Some manuscripts read Think of how people hurt themselves by opposing him.\n12:5a Greek sons; also in 12:7, 8.\n12:5b Greek son; also in 12:6, 7.\n12:5-6 Prov 3:11-12 (Greek version).\n12:9 Or and really live?\n12:18 Greek to something that can be touched.\n12:20 Exod 19:13.\n12:21 Deut 9:19.\n12:26 Hag 2:6.", :number "12", :title "Hebrews 12", :translation "NLT", :book "Hebrews"} {:text "A Warning against Drifting Away\n\n2 So we must listen very carefully to the truth we have heard, or we may drift away from it. 2 For the message God delivered through angels has always stood firm, and every violation of the law and every act of disobedience was punished. 3 So what makes us think we can escape if we ignore this great salvation that was first announced by the Lord Jesus himself and then delivered to us by those who heard him speak? 4 And God confirmed the message by giving signs and wonders and various miracles and gifts of the Holy Spirit whenever he chose.\n\nJesus, the Man\n\n5 And furthermore, it is not angels who will control the future world we are talking about. 6 For in one place the Scriptures say,\n\n“What are mere mortals that you should think about them,\n    or a son of man[a] that you should care for him?\n\n7 \nYet for a little while you made them a little lower than the angels\n    and crowned them with glory and honor.[b]\n\n8 \nYou gave them authority over all things.”[c]\n\nNow when it says “all things,” it means nothing is left out. But we have not yet seen all things put under their authority. 9 What we do see is Jesus, who for a little while was given a position “a little lower than the angels”; and because he suffered death for us, he is now “crowned with glory and honor.” Yes, by God’s grace, Jesus tasted death for everyone. 10 God, for whom and through whom everything was made, chose to bring many children into glory. And it was only right that he should make Jesus, through his suffering, a perfect leader, fit to bring them into their salvation.\n\n11 So now Jesus and the ones he makes holy have the same Father. That is why Jesus is not ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters.[d] 12 For he said to God,\n\n“I will proclaim your name to my brothers and sisters.\n    I will praise you among your assembled people.”[e]\n\n13 He also said,\n\n“I will put my trust in him,”\n    that is, “I and the children God has given me.”[f]\n\n14 Because God’s children are human beings—made of flesh and blood—the Son also became flesh and blood.

Then he could offer a sacrifice that would take away the sins of the people. 18 Since he himself has gone through suffering and testing, he is able to help us when we are being tested.\n\nFootnotes\n2:6 Or the Son of Man.\n2:7 Some manuscripts add You gave them charge of everything you made.\n2:6-8 Ps 8:4-6 (Greek version).\n2:11 Greek brothers; also in 2:12.\n2:12 Ps 22:22.\n2:13 Isa 8:17-18.\n2:14 Or has.\n2:17 Greek like the brothers.", :number "2", :title "Hebrews 2", :translation "NLT", :book "Hebrews"} {:text "Melchizedek Is Greater Than Abraham\n\n7 This Melchizedek was king of the city of Salem and also a priest of God Most High. When Abraham was returning home after winning a great battle against the kings, Melchizedek met him and blessed him. 2 Then Abraham took a tenth of all he had captured in battle and gave it to Melchizedek. The name Melchizedek means “king of justice,” and king of Salem means “king of peace.” 3 There is no record of his father or mother or any of his ancestors—no beginning or end to his life. He remains a priest forever, resembling the Son of God.\n\n4 Consider then how great this Melchizedek was. Even Abraham, the great patriarch of Israel, recognized this by giving him a tenth of what he had taken in battle. 5 Now the law of Moses required that the priests, who are descendants of Levi, must collect a tithe from the rest of the people of Israel,[a] who are also descendants of Abraham. 6 But Melchizedek, who was not a descendant of Levi, collected a tenth from Abraham. And Melchizedek placed a blessing upon Abraham, the one who had already received the promises of God. 7 And without question, the person who has the power to give a blessing is greater than the one who is blessed.\n\n8 The priests who collect tithes are men who die, so Melchizedek is greater than they are, because we are told that he lives on. 9 In addition, we might even say that these Levites—the ones who collect the tithe—paid a tithe to Melchizedek when their ancestor Abraham paid a tithe to him. 10 For although Levi wasn’t born yet, the seed from which he came was in Abraham’s body when Melchizedek collected the tithe from him.\n\n11 So if the priesthood of Levi, on which the law was based, could have achieved the perfection God intended, why did God need to establish a different priesthood, with a priest in the order of Melchizedek instead of the order of Levi and Aaron?[b]\n\n12 And if the priesthood is changed, the law must also be changed to permit it. 13 For the priest we are talking about belongs to a different tribe, whose members have never served at the altar as priests. 14 What I mean is, our Lord came from the tribe of Judah, and Moses never mentioned priests coming from that tribe.\n\nJesus Is like Melchizedek\n\n15 This change has been made very clear since a different priest, who is like Melchizedek, has appeared. 16 Jesus became a priest, not by meeting the physical requirement of belonging to the tribe of Levi, but by the power of a life that cannot be destroyed. 17 And the psalmist pointed this out when he prophesied,\n\n“You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.”[c]\n\n18 Yes, the old requirement about the priesthood was set aside because it was weak and useless. 19 For the law never made anything perfect. But now we have confidence in a better hope, through which we draw near to God.\n\n20 This new system was established with a solemn oath. Aaron’s descendants became priests without such an oath, 21 but there was an oath regarding Jesus. For God said to him,\n\n“The Lord has taken an oath and will not break his vow:\n    ‘You are a priest forever.’”[d]\n\n22 Because of this oath, Jesus is the one who guarantees this better covenant with God.\n\n23 There were many priests under the old system, for death prevented them from remaining in office. 24 But because Jesus lives forever, his priesthood lasts forever. 25 Therefore he is able, once and forever, to save[e] those who come to God through him. He lives forever to intercede with God on their behalf.\n\n26 He is the kind of high priest we need because he is holy and blameless, unstained by sin. He has been set apart from sinners and has been given the highest place of honor in heaven.[f] 27 Unlike those other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices every day. They did this for their own sins first and then for the sins of the people. But Jesus did this once for all when he offered himself as the sacrifice for the people’s sins. 28 The law appointed high priests who were limited by human weakness. But after the law was given, God appointed his Son with an oath, and his Son has been made the perfect High Priest forever.\n\nFootnotes\n7:5 Greek from their brothers.\n7:11 Greek the order of Aaron?\n7:17 Ps 110:4.\n7:21 Ps 110:4.\n7:25 Or is able to save completely.\n7:26 Or has been exalted higher than the heavens.", :number "7", :title "Hebrews 7", :translation "NLT", :book "Hebrews"} {:text "Christ Is Our High Priest\n\n8 Here is the main point: We have a High Priest who sat down in the place of honor beside the throne of the majestic God in heaven. 2 There he ministers in the heavenly Tabernacle,[a] the true place of worship that was built by the Lord and not by human hands.\n\n3 And since every high priest is required to offer gifts and sacrifices, our High Priest must make an offering, too. 4 If he were here on earth, he would not even be a priest, since there already are priests who offer the gifts required by the law. 5 They serve in a system of worship that is only a copy, a shadow of the real one in heaven. For when Moses was getting ready to build the Tabernacle, God gave him this warning: “Be sure that you make everything according to the pattern I have shown you here on the mountain.”[b]\n\n6 But now Jesus, our High Priest, has been given a ministry that is far superior to the old priesthood, for he is the one who mediates for us a far better covenant with God, based on better promises.\n\n7 If the first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need for a second covenant to replace it. 8 But when God found fault with the people, he said:\n\n“The day is coming, says the Lord,\n    when I will make a new covenant\n    with the people of Israel and Judah.\n\n9 \nThis covenant will not be like the one\n    I made with their ancestors\nwhen I took them by the hand\n    and led them out of the land of Egypt.\nThey did not remain faithful to my covenant,\n    so I turned my back on them, says the Lord.\n\n10 \nBut this is the new covenant I will make\n    with the people of Israel on that day,[c] says the Lord:\nI will put my laws in their minds,\n    and I will write them on their hearts.\nI will be their God,\n    and they will be my people.\n\n11 \nAnd they will not need to teach their neighbors,\n    nor will they need to teach their relatives,[d]\n    saying, ‘You should know the Lord.’\nFor everyone, from the least to the greatest,\n    will know me already.\n\n12 \nAnd I will forgive their wickedness,\n    and I will never again remember their sins.”[e]\n\n13 When God speaks of a “new” covenant, it means he has made the first one obsolete.

Let us go on instead and become mature in our understanding. Surely we don’t need to start again with the fundamental importance of repenting from evil deeds[a] and placing our faith in God. 2 You don’t need further instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. 3 And so, God willing, we will move forward to further understanding.\n\n4 For it is impossible to bring back to repentance those who were once enlightened—those who have experienced the good things of heaven and shared in the Holy Spirit, 5 who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the power of the age to come— 6 and who then turn away from God. It is impossible to bring such people back to repentance; by rejecting the Son of God, they themselves are nailing him to the cross once again and holding him up to public shame.\n\n7 When the ground soaks up the falling rain and bears a good crop for the farmer, it has God’s blessing. 8 But if a field bears thorns and thistles, it is useless. The farmer will soon condemn that field and burn it.\n\n9 Dear friends, even though we are talking this way, we really don’t believe it applies to you. We are confident that you are meant for better things, things that come with salvation. 10 For God is not unjust. He will not forget how hard you have worked for him and how you have shown your love to him by caring for other believers,[b] as you still do. 11 Our great desire is that you will keep on loving others as long as life lasts, in order to make certain that what you hope for will come true. 12 Then you will not become spiritually dull and indifferent. Instead, you will follow the example of those who are going to inherit God’s promises because of their faith and endurance.\n\nGod’s Promises Bring Hope\n\n13 For example, there was God’s promise to Abraham. Since there was no one greater to swear by, God took an oath in his own name, saying:\n\n14 \n“I will certainly bless you,\n    and I will multiply your descendants beyond number.”[c]\n\n15 Then Abraham waited patiently, and he received what God had promised.\n\n16 Now when people take an oath, they call on someone greater than themselves to hold them to it. And without any question that oath is binding. 17 God also bound himself with an oath, so that those who received the promise could be perfectly sure that he would never change his mind. 18 So God has given both his promise and his oath. These two things are unchangeable because it is impossible for God to lie. Therefore, we who have fled to him for refuge can have great confidence as we hold to the hope that lies before us. 19 This hope is a strong and trustworthy anchor for our souls. It leads us through the curtain into God’s inner sanctuary. 20 Jesus has already gone in there for us. He has become our eternal High Priest in the order of Melchizedek.\n\nFootnotes\n6:1 Greek from dead works.\n6:10 Greek for God’s holy people.\n6:14 Gen 22:17.", :number "6", :title "Hebrews 6", :translation "NLT", :book "Hebrews"} {:text "Promised Rest for God’s People\n\n4 God’s promise of entering his rest still stands, so we ought to tremble with fear that some of you might fail to experience it. 2 For this good news—that God has prepared this rest—has been announced to us just as it was to them. But it did them no good because they didn’t share the faith of those who listened to God.[a] 3 For only we who believe can enter his rest. As for the others, God said,\n\n“In my anger I took an oath:\n    ‘They will never enter my place of rest,’”[b]\n\neven though this rest has been ready since he made the world. 4 We know it is ready because of the place in the Scriptures where it mentions the seventh day: “On the seventh day God rested from all his work.”[c] 5 But in the other passage God said, “They will never enter my place of rest.”[d]\n\n6 So God’s rest is there for people to enter, but those who first heard this good news failed to enter because they disobeyed God. 7 So God set another time for entering his rest, and that time is today. God announced this through David much later in the words already quoted:\n\n“Today when you hear his voice,\n    don’t harden your hearts.”[e]\n\n8 Now if Joshua had succeeded in giving them this rest, God would not have spoken about another day of rest still to come. 9 So there is a special rest[f] still waiting for the people of God. 10 For all who have entered into God’s rest have rested from their labors, just as God did after creating the world. 11 So let us do our best to enter that rest. But if we disobey God, as the people of Israel did, we will fall.\n\n12 For the word of God is alive and powerful. It is sharper than the sharpest two-edged sword, cutting between soul and spirit, between joint and marrow. It exposes our innermost thoughts and desires. 13 Nothing in all creation is hidden from God. Everything is naked and exposed before his eyes, and he is the one to whom we are accountable.\n\nChrist Is Our High Priest\n\n14 So then, since we have a great High Priest who has entered heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to what we believe. 15 This High Priest of ours understands our weaknesses, for he faced all of the same testings we do, yet he did not sin. 16 So let us come boldly to the throne of our gracious God. There we will receive his mercy, and we will find grace to help us when we need it most.\n\nFootnotes\n4:2 Some manuscripts read they didn’t combine what they heard with faith.\n4:3 Ps 95:11.\n4:4 Gen 2:2.\n4:5 Ps 95:11.\n4:7 Ps 95:7-8.\n4:9 Or a Sabbath rest.", :number "4", :title "Hebrews 4", :translation "NLT", :book "Hebrews"} {:text "Christ’s Sacrifice Once for All\n\n10 The old system under the law of Moses was only a shadow, a dim preview of the good things to come, not the good things themselves. The sacrifices under that system were repeated again and again, year after year, but they were never able to provide perfect cleansing for those who came to worship. 2 If they could have provided perfect cleansing, the sacrifices would have stopped, for the worshipers would have been purified once for all time, and their feelings of guilt would have disappeared.\n\n3 But instead, those sacrifices actually reminded them of their sins year after year. 4 For it is not possible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. 5 That is why, when Christ[a] came into the world, he said to God,\n\n“You did not want animal sacrifices or sin offerings.\n    But you have given me a body to offer.\n\n6 \nYou were not pleased with burnt offerings\n    or other offerings for sin.\n\n7 \nThen I said, ‘Look, I have come to do your will, O God—\n    as is written about me in the Scriptures.’”[b]\n\n8 First, Christ said, “You did not want animal sacrifices or sin offerings or burnt offerings or other offerings for sin, nor were you pleased with them” (though they are required by the law of Moses). 9 Then he said, “Look, I have come to do your will.” He cancels the first covenant in order to put the second into effect. 10 For God’s will was for us to be made holy by the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ, once for all time.\n\n11 Under the old covenant, the priest stands and ministers before the altar day after day, offering the same sacrifices again and again, which can never take away sins. 12 But our High Priest offered himself to God as a single sacrifice for sins, good for all time. Then he sat down in the place of honor at God’s right hand. 13 There he waits until his enemies are humbled and made a footstool under his feet. 14 For by that one offering he forever made perfect those who are being made holy.\n\n15 And the Holy Spirit also testifies that this is so. For he says,\n\n16 \n“This is the new covenant I will make\n    with my people on that day,[c] says the Lord:\nI will put my laws in their hearts,\n    and I will write them on their minds.”[d]\n\n17 Then he says,\n\n“I will never again remember\n    their sins and lawless deeds.”[e]\n\n18 And when sins have been forgiven, there is no need to offer any more sacrifices.\n\nA Call to Persevere\n\n19 And so, dear brothers and sisters,[f] we can boldly enter heaven’s Most Holy Place because of the blood of Jesus. 20 By his death,[g] Jesus opened a new and life-giving way through the curtain into the Most Holy Place. 21 And since we have a great High Priest who rules over God’s house, 22 let us go right into the presence of God with sincere hearts fully trusting him. For our guilty consciences have been sprinkled with Christ’s blood to make us clean, and our bodies have been washed with pure water.\n\n23 Let us hold tightly without wavering to the hope we affirm, for God can be trusted to keep his promise. 24 Let us think of ways to motivate one another to acts of love and good works. 25 And let us not neglect our meeting together, as some people do, but encourage one another, especially now that the day of his return is drawing near.\n\n26 Dear friends, if we deliberately continue sinning after we have received knowledge of the truth, there is no longer any sacrifice that will cover these sins. 27 There is only the terrible expectation of God’s judgment and the raging fire that will consume his enemies. 28 For anyone who refused to obey the law of Moses was put to death without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. 29 Just think how much worse the punishment will be for those who have trampled on the Son of God, and have treated the blood of the covenant, which made us holy, as if it were common and unholy, and have insulted and disdained the Holy Spirit who brings God’s mercy to us. 30 For we know the one who said,\n\n“I will take revenge.\n    I will pay them back.”[h]\n\nHe also said,\n\n“The Lord will judge his own people.”[i]\n\n31 It is a terrible thing to fall into the hands of the living God.\n\n32 Think back on those early days when you first learned about Christ.[j] Remember how you remained faithful even though it meant terrible suffering. 33 Sometimes you were exposed to public ridicule and were beaten, and sometimes you helped others who were suffering the same things. 34 You suffered along with those who were thrown into jail, and when all you owned was taken from you, you accepted it with joy. You knew there were better things waiting for you that will last forever.\n\n35 So do not throw away this confident trust in the Lord. Remember the great reward it brings you! 36 Patient endurance is what you need now, so that you will continue to do God’s will. Then you will receive all that he has promised.\n\n37 \n“For in just a little while,\n    the Coming One will come and not delay.\n\n38 \nAnd my righteous ones will live by faith.[k]\n    But I will take no pleasure in anyone who turns away.”[l]\n\n39 But we are not like those who turn away from God to their own destruction.

This room was called the Holy Place. 3 Then there was a curtain, and behind the curtain was the second room[b] called the Most Holy Place. 4 In that room were a gold incense altar and a wooden chest called the Ark of the Covenant, which was covered with gold on all sides. Inside the Ark were a gold jar containing manna, Aaron’s staff that sprouted leaves, and the stone tablets of the covenant. 5 Above the Ark were the cherubim of divine glory, whose wings stretched out over the Ark’s cover, the place of atonement. But we cannot explain these things in detail now.\n\n6 When these things were all in place, the priests regularly entered the first room[c] as they performed their religious duties. 7 But only the high priest ever entered the Most Holy Place, and only once a year. And he always offered blood for his own sins and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance. 8 By these regulations the Holy Spirit revealed that the entrance to the Most Holy Place was not freely open as long as the Tabernacle[d] and the system it represented were still in use.\n\n9 This is an illustration pointing to the present time. For the gifts and sacrifices that the priests offer are not able to cleanse the consciences of the people who bring them. 10 For that old system deals only with food and drink and various cleansing ceremonies—physical regulations that were in effect only until a better system could be established.\n\nChrist Is the Perfect Sacrifice\n\n11 So Christ has now become the High Priest over all the good things that have come.[e] He has entered that greater, more perfect Tabernacle in heaven, which was not made by human hands and is not part of this created world. 12 With his own blood—not the blood of goats and calves—he entered the Most Holy Place once for all time and secured our redemption forever.\n\n13 Under the old system, the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer could cleanse people’s bodies from ceremonial impurity. 14 Just think how much more the blood of Christ will purify our consciences from sinful deeds[f] so that we can worship the living God. For by the power of the eternal Spirit, Christ offered himself to God as a perfect sacrifice for our sins. 15 That is why he is the one who mediates a new covenant between God and people, so that all who are called can receive the eternal inheritance God has promised them. For Christ died to set them free from the penalty of the sins they had committed under that first covenant.\n\n16 Now when someone leaves a will,[g] it is necessary to prove that the person who made it is dead.[h] 17 The will goes into effect only after the person’s death. While the person who made it is still alive, the will cannot be put into effect.\n\n18 That is why even the first covenant was put into effect with the blood of an animal. 19 For after Moses had read each of God’s commandments to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats,[i] along with water, and sprinkled both the book of God’s law and all the people, using hyssop branches and scarlet wool. 20 Then he said, “This blood confirms the covenant God has made with you.”[j] 21 And in the same way, he sprinkled blood on the Tabernacle and on everything used for worship. 22 In fact, according to the law of Moses, nearly everything was purified with blood. For without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness.\n\n23 That is why the Tabernacle and everything in it, which were copies of things in heaven, had to be purified by the blood of animals. But the real things in heaven had to be purified with far better sacrifices than the blood of animals.\n\n24 For Christ did not enter into a holy place made with human hands, which was only a copy of the true one in heaven. He entered into heaven itself to appear now before God on our behalf. 25 And he did not enter heaven to offer himself again and again, like the high priest here on earth who enters the Most Holy Place year after year with the blood of an animal. 26 If that had been necessary, Christ would have had to die again and again, ever since the world began. But now, once for all time, he has appeared at the end of the age[k] to remove sin by his own death as a sacrifice.\n\n27 And just as each person is destined to die once and after that comes judgment, 28 so also Christ was offered once for all time as a sacrifice to take away the sins of many people. He will come again, not to deal with our sins, but to bring salvation to all who are eagerly waiting for him.\n\nFootnotes\n9:2 Or tent; also in 9:11, 21.\n9:3 Greek second tent.\n9:6 Greek first tent.\n9:8 Or the first room; Greek reads the first tent.\n9:11 Some manuscripts read that are about to come.\n9:14 Greek from dead works.\n9:16a Or covenant; also in 9:17.\n9:16b Or Now when someone makes a covenant, it is necessary to ratify it with the death of a sacrifice.\n9:19 Some manuscripts do not include and goats.\n9:20 Exod 24:8.\n9:26 Greek the ages.", :number "9", :title "Hebrews 9", :translation "NLT", :book "Hebrews"}]
