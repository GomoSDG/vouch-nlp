[{:text "Habakkuk’s Prayer\n\n3 This prayer was sung by the prophet Habakkuk[a]:\n\n2 \nI have heard all about you, Lord.\n    I am filled with awe by your amazing works.\nIn this time of our deep need,\n    help us again as you did in years gone by.\nAnd in your anger,\n    remember your mercy.\n\n3 \nI see God moving across the deserts from Edom,[b]\n    the Holy One coming from Mount Paran.[c]\nHis brilliant splendor fills the heavens,\n    and the earth is filled with his praise.\n\n4 \nHis coming is as brilliant as the sunrise.\n    Rays of light flash from his hands,\n    where his awesome power is hidden.\n\n5 \nPestilence marches before him;\n    plague follows close behind.\n\n6 \nWhen he stops, the earth shakes.\n    When he looks, the nations tremble.\nHe shatters the everlasting mountains\n    and levels the eternal hills.\n    He is the Eternal One![d]\n\n7 \nI see the people of Cushan in distress,\n    and the nation of Midian trembling in terror.\n\n8 \nWas it in anger, Lord, that you struck the rivers\n    and parted the sea?\nWere you displeased with them?\n    No, you were sending your chariots of salvation!\n\n9 \nYou brandished your bow\n    and your quiver of arrows.\n    You split open the earth with flowing rivers.\n\n10 \nThe mountains watched and trembled.\n    Onward swept the raging waters.\nThe mighty deep cried out,\n    lifting its hands in submission.\n\n11 \nThe sun and moon stood still in the sky\n    as your brilliant arrows flew\n    and your glittering spear flashed.\n\n12 \nYou marched across the land in anger\n    and trampled the nations in your fury.\n\n13 \nYou went out to rescue your chosen people,\n    to save your anointed ones.\nYou crushed the heads of the wicked\n    and stripped their bones from head to toe.\n\n14 \nWith his own weapons,\n    you destroyed the chief of those\nwho rushed out like a whirlwind,\n    thinking Israel would be easy prey.\n\n15 \nYou trampled the sea with your horses,\n    and the mighty waters piled high.\n\n16 \nI trembled inside when I heard this;\n    my lips quivered with fear.\nMy legs gave way beneath me,[e]\n    and I shook in terror.\nI will wait quietly for the coming day\n    when disaster will strike the people who invade us.\n\n17 \nEven though the fig trees have no blossoms,\n    and there are no grapes on the vines;\neven though the olive crop fails,\n    and the fields lie empty and barren;\neven though the flocks die in the fields,\n    and the cattle barns are empty,\n\n18 \nyet I will rejoice in the Lord!\n    I will be joyful in the God of my salvation!\n\n19 \nThe Sovereign Lord is my strength!\n    He makes me as surefooted as a deer,[f]\n    able to tread upon the heights.\n\n(For the choir director: This prayer is to be accompanied by stringed instruments.)\n\nFootnotes\n3:1 Hebrew adds according to shigionoth, probably indicating the musical setting for the prayer.\n3:3a Hebrew Teman.\n3:3b Hebrew adds selah; also in 3:9, 13.
