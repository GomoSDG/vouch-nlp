[{:text "Locusts Invade like an Army\n\n2 \nSound the trumpet in Jerusalem[a]!\n    Raise the alarm on my holy mountain!\nLet everyone tremble in fear\n    because the day of the Lord is upon us.\n\n2 \nIt is a day of darkness and gloom,\n    a day of thick clouds and deep blackness.\nSuddenly, like dawn spreading across the mountains,\n    a great and mighty army appears.\nNothing like it has been seen before\n    or will ever be seen again.\n\n3 \nFire burns in front of them,\n    and flames follow after them.\nAhead of them the land lies\n    as beautiful as the Garden of Eden.\nBehind them is nothing but desolation;\n    not one thing escapes.\n\n4 \nThey look like horses;\n    they charge forward like warhorses.[b]\n\n5 \nLook at them as they leap along the mountaintops.\n    Listen to the noise they make—like the rumbling of chariots,\nlike the roar of fire sweeping across a field of stubble,\n    or like a mighty army moving into battle.\n\n6 \nFear grips all the people;\n    every face grows pale with terror.\n\n7 \nThe attackers march like warriors\n    and scale city walls like soldiers.\nStraight forward they march,\n    never breaking rank.\n\n8 \nThey never jostle each other;\n    each moves in exactly the right position.\nThey break through defenses\n    without missing a step.\n\n9 \nThey swarm over the city\n    and run along its walls.\nThey enter all the houses,\n    climbing like thieves through the windows.\n\n10 \nThe earth quakes as they advance,\n    and the heavens tremble.\nThe sun and moon grow dark,\n    and the stars no longer shine.\n\n11 \nThe Lord is at the head of the column.\n    He leads them with a shout.\nThis is his mighty army,\n    and they follow his orders.\nThe day of the Lord is an awesome, terrible thing.\n    Who can possibly survive?\n\nA Call to Repentance\n\n12 \nThat is why the Lord says,\n    “Turn to me now, while there is time.\nGive me your hearts.\n    Come with fasting, weeping, and mourning.\n\n13 \nDon’t tear your clothing in your grief,\n    but tear your hearts instead.”\nReturn to the Lord your God,\n    for he is merciful and compassionate,\nslow to get angry and filled with unfailing love.\n    He is eager to relent and not punish.\n\n14 \nWho knows? Perhaps he will give you a reprieve,\n    sending you a blessing instead of this curse.\nPerhaps you will be able to offer grain and wine\n    to the Lord your God as before.\n\n15 \nBlow the ram’s horn in Jerusalem!\n    Announce a time of fasting;\ncall the people together\n    for a solemn meeting.\n\n16 \nGather all the people—\n    the elders, the children, and even the babies.\nCall the bridegroom from his quarters\n    and the bride from her private room.\n\n17 \nLet the priests, who minister in the Lord’s presence,\n    stand and weep between the entry room to the Temple and the altar.\nLet them pray, “Spare your people, Lord!\n    Don’t let your special possession become an object of mockery.\nDon’t let them become a joke for unbelieving foreigners who say,\n    ‘Has the God of Israel left them?’”\n\nThe Lord’s Promise of Restoration\n\n18 \nThen the Lord will pity his people\n    and jealously guard the honor of his land.\n\n19 \nThe Lord will reply,\n“Look! I am sending you grain and new wine and olive oil,\n    enough to satisfy your needs.\nYou will no longer be an object of mockery\n    among the surrounding nations.\n\n20 \nI will drive away these armies from the north.\n    I will send them into the parched wastelands.\nThose in the front will be driven into the Dead Sea,\n    and those at the rear into the Mediterranean.[c]\nThe stench of their rotting bodies will rise over the land.”\n\nSurely the Lord has done great things!\n\n21 \n    Don’t be afraid, O land.\nBe glad now and rejoice,\n    for the Lord has done great things.\n\n22 \nDon’t be afraid, you animals of the field,\n    for the wilderness pastures will soon be green.\nThe trees will again be filled with fruit;\n    fig trees and grapevines will be loaded down once more.\n\n23 \nRejoice, you people of Jerusalem!\n    Rejoice in the Lord your God!\nFor the rain he sends demonstrates his faithfulness.\n    Once more the autumn rains will come,\n    as well as the rains of spring.\n\n24 \nThe threshing floors will again be piled high with grain,\n    and the presses will overflow with new wine and olive oil.\n\n25 \nThe Lord says, “I will give you back what you lost\n    to the swarming locusts, the hopping locusts,\nthe stripping locusts, and the cutting locusts.[d]\n    It was I who sent this great destroying army against you.\n\n26 \nOnce again you will have all the food you want,\n    and you will praise the Lord your God,\nwho does these miracles for you.\n    Never again will my people be disgraced.\n\n27 \nThen you will know that I am among my people Israel,\n    that I am the Lord your God, and there is no other.\n    Never again will my people be disgraced.\n\nThe Lord’s Promise of His Spirit\n\n28 \n[e]“Then, after doing all those things,\n    I will pour out my Spirit upon all people.\nYour sons and daughters will prophesy.\n    Your old men will dream dreams,\n    and your young men will see visions.\n\n29 \nIn those days I will pour out my Spirit\n    even on servants—men and women alike.\n\n30 \nAnd I will cause wonders in the heavens and on the earth—\n    blood and fire and columns of smoke.\n\n31 \nThe sun will become dark,\n    and the moon will turn blood red\n    before that great and terrible[f] day of the Lord arrives.\n\n32 \nBut everyone who calls on the name of the Lord\n    will be saved,\nfor some on Mount Zion in Jerusalem will escape,\n    just as the Lord has said.\nThese will be among the survivors\n    whom the Lord has called.\n\nFootnotes\n2:1 Hebrew Zion;
