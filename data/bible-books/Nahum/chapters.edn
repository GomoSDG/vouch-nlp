[{:text "1 This message concerning Nineveh came as a vision to Nahum, who lived in Elkosh.\n\nThe Lord’s Anger against Nineveh\n\n2 \nThe Lord is a jealous God,\n    filled with vengeance and rage.\nHe takes revenge on all who oppose him\n    and continues to rage against his enemies!\n\n3 \nThe Lord is slow to get angry, but his power is great,\n    and he never lets the guilty go unpunished.\nHe displays his power in the whirlwind and the storm.\n    The billowing clouds are the dust beneath his feet.\n\n4 \nAt his command the oceans dry up,\n    and the rivers disappear.\nThe lush pastures of Bashan and Carmel fade,\n    and the green forests of Lebanon wither.\n\n5 \nIn his presence the mountains quake,\n    and the hills melt away;\nthe earth trembles,\n    and its people are destroyed.\n\n6 \nWho can stand before his fierce anger?\n    Who can survive his burning fury?\nHis rage blazes forth like fire,\n    and the mountains crumble to dust in his presence.\n\n7 \nThe Lord is good,\n    a strong refuge when trouble comes.\n    He is close to those who trust in him.\n\n8 \nBut he will sweep away his enemies[a]\n    in an overwhelming flood.\nHe will pursue his foes\n    into the darkness of night.\n\n9 \nWhy are you scheming against the Lord?\n    He will destroy you with one blow;\n    he won’t need to strike twice!\n\n10 \nHis enemies, tangled like thornbushes\n    and staggering like drunks,\n    will be burned up like dry stubble in a field.\n\n11 \nWho is this wicked counselor of yours\n    who plots evil against the Lord?\n\n12 \nThis is what the Lord says:\n“Though the Assyrians have many allies,\n    they will be destroyed and disappear.\nO my people, I have punished you before,\n    but I will not punish you again.\n\n13 \nNow I will break the yoke of bondage from your neck\n    and tear off the chains of Assyrian oppression.”\n\n14 \nAnd this is what the Lord says concerning the Assyrians in Nineveh:\n“You will have no more children to carry on your name.\n    I will destroy all the idols in the temples of your gods.\nI am preparing a grave for you\n    because you are despicable!”\n\n15 \n[b]Look! A messenger is coming over the mountains with good news!\n    He is bringing a message of peace.\nCelebrate your festivals, O people of Judah,\n    and fulfill all your vows,\nfor your wicked enemies will never invade your land again.\n    They will be completely destroyed!\n\nFootnotes\n1:8 As in Greek version; Hebrew reads sweep away her place.\n1:15 Verse 1:15 is numbered 2:1 in Hebrew text.", :number "1", :title "Nahum 1", :translation "NLT", :book "Nahum"} {:text "The Fall of Nineveh\n\n2 \n[a]Your enemy is coming to crush you, Nineveh.\n    Man the ramparts!

splendor.\n\n3 \nShields flash red in the sunlight!\n    See the scarlet uniforms of the valiant troops!\nWatch as their glittering chariots move into position,\n    with a forest of spears waving above them.[b]\n\n4 \nThe chariots race recklessly along the streets\n    and rush wildly through the squares.\nThey flash like firelight\n    and move as swiftly as lightning.\n\n5 \nThe king shouts to his officers;\n    they stumble in their haste,\n    rushing to the walls to set up their defenses.\n\n6 \nThe river gates have been torn open!\n    The palace is about to collapse!\n\n7 \nNineveh’s exile has been decreed,\n    and all the servant girls mourn its capture.\nThey moan like doves\n    and beat their breasts in sorrow.\n\n8 \nNineveh is like a leaking water

treasures—\n    its vast, uncounted wealth.\n\n10 \nSoon the city is plundered, empty, and ruined.\n    Hearts melt and knees shake.\nThe people stand aghast,\n    their faces pale and trembling.\n\n11 \nWhere now is that great Nineveh,\n    that den filled with young lions?\nIt was a place where people—like lions and their cubs—\n    walked freely and without fear.\n\n12 \nThe lion tore up meat for his cubs\n    and strangled prey for his mate.\nHe filled his den with prey,\n    his caverns with his plunder.\n\n13 \n“I am your enemy!”\n    says the Lord of Heaven’s

glittering spears\n    as the charioteers charge past!\nThere are countless casualties,\n    heaps of bodies—\nso many bodies that\n    people stumble over them.\n\n4 \nAll this because Nineveh,\n    the beautiful and faithless city,\nmistress of deadly charms,\n    enticed the nations with her beauty.\nShe taught them all her magic,\n    enchanting people everywhere.\n\n5 \n“I am your enemy!”\n    says the Lord of Heaven’s Armies.\n“And now I will lift your skirts\n    and show all the earth your nakedness and shame.\n\n6 \nI will cover you with filth\n    and show the world how vile you really are.\n\n7 \nAll who see you will shrink back and say,\n    ‘Nineveh lies in ruins.\nWhere are the mourners?’\n    Does anyone regret your destruction?”\n\n8 \nAre you any better than the city of Thebes,[a]\n    situated on the Nile River, surrounded by water?\nShe was protected by the river on all sides,\n    walled in by water.\n\n9 \nEthiopia[b] and the land of Egypt\n    gave unlimited assistance.\nThe nations of Put and Libya\n    were among her allies.\n\n10 \nYet Thebes fell,\n    and her people were led away as captives.\nHer babies were dashed to death\n    against the stones of the streets.\nSoldiers threw dice[c] to get Egyptian officers as servants.\n    All their leaders were bound in chains.\n\n11 \nAnd you, Nineveh, will also stagger like a drunkard.\n    You will hide for fear of the attacking enemy.\n\n12 \nAll your fortresses will fall.\n    They will be devoured like the ripe figs\nthat fall into the mouths\n    of those who shake the trees.\n\n13 \nYour troops will be as weak\n    and helpless as women.\nThe gates of your land will be opened wide to the enemy\n    and set on fire and burned.\n\n14 \nGet ready for the

you;\n    the sword will cut you down.\nThe enemy will consume you like locusts,\n    devouring everything they see.\nThere will be no escape,\n    even if you multiply like swarming locusts.\n\n16 \nYour merchants have multiplied\n    until they outnumber the stars.\nBut like a swarm of locusts,\n    they strip the land and fly away.\n\n17 \nYour guards[d] and officials are also like swarming locusts\n    that crowd together in the hedges on a cold day.\nBut like locusts that fly away when the sun comes up,\n    all of them will fly away and disappear.\n\n18 \nYour shepherds
