sleet.\n\n48 \nHe abandoned their cattle to the hail,\n    their livestock to bolts of lightning.\n\n49 \nHe loosed on them his fierce anger—\n    all his fury, rage, and hostility.\nHe dispatched against them\n    a band of destroying angels.\n\n50 \nHe turned his anger against them;\n    he did not spare the Egyptians’ lives\n    but ravaged them with the plague.\n\n51 \nHe killed the oldest son in each Egyptian family,\n    the flower of youth throughout the land of Egypt.[c]\n\n52 \nBut he led his own people like a flock of sheep,\n    guiding them safely through the

them.\n\n55 \nHe drove out the nations before them;\n    he gave them their inheritance by lot.\n    He settled the tribes of Israel into their homes.\n\n56 \nBut they kept testing and rebelling

building shrines to other gods;\n    they made him jealous with their idols.\n\n59 \nWhen God heard them, he was very angry,\n    and he completely rejected Israel.\n\n60 \nThen he abandoned his dwelling at Shiloh,\n    the Tabernacle where he had lived among the people.\n\n61 \nHe allowed the Ark of his might to be captured;\n    he surrendered his glory into enemy hands.\n\n62 \nHe gave his people over to be butchered by the sword,\n    because he was so angry with his own people—his special possession.\n\n63 \nTheir young men were killed by fire;\n    their young women died before

chose instead the tribe of Judah,\n    and Mount Zion, which he loved.\n\n69 \nThere he built his sanctuary as high as the heavens,\n    as solid and enduring as the earth.\n\n70 \nHe chose his
