A man will give up everything he has to save his life. 5 But reach out and take away his health, and he will surely curse you to your face!”\n\n6 “All right, do with him as you please,” the Lord said to Satan. “But spare his life.” 7 So Satan left the Lord’s presence, and he struck Job with terrible boils from head to foot.\n\n8 Job scraped his skin with a piece of broken pottery as he sat among the ashes. 9 His wife said to him, “Are you still trying to maintain your integrity? Curse God and die.”\n\n10 But Job replied, “You talk like a foolish woman. Should we accept only good things from the hand of God and never anything bad?” So in all this, Job said nothing wrong.\n\nJob’s Three Friends Share His Anguish\n\n11 When three of Job’s friends heard of the tragedy he had suffered, they got together and traveled from their homes to comfort and console him.

Wailing loudly, they tore their robes and threw dust into the air over their heads to show their grief. 13 Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and nights.

He was blameless—a man of complete integrity. He feared God and stayed away from evil. 2 He had seven sons and three daughters. 3 He owned 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 teams of oxen, and 500 female donkeys. He also had many servants. He was, in fact, the richest person in that entire area.\n\n4 Job’s sons would take turns preparing feasts in their homes, and they would also invite their three sisters to celebrate with them. 5 When these celebrations ended—sometimes after several days—Job would purify his children. He would get up early in the morning and offer a burnt offering for each of them. For Job said to himself, “Perhaps my children have sinned and have cursed God in their hearts.” This was Job’s regular practice.\n\nJob’s First Test\n\n6 One day the members of the heavenly court[a] came to present themselves before the Lord, and the Accuser, Satan,[b] came with them. 7 “Where have you come from?” the Lord asked Satan.\n\nSatan answered the Lord, “I have been patrolling the earth, watching everything that’s going on.”\n\n8 Then the Lord asked Satan, “Have you noticed my servant Job? He is the finest man in all the earth. He is blameless—a man of complete integrity. He fears God and stays away from evil.”\n\n9 Satan replied to the Lord, “Yes, but Job has good reason to fear God. 10 You have always put a wall of protection around him and his home and his property. You have made him prosper in everything he does. Look how rich he is! 11 But reach out and take away everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face!”\n\n12 “All right, you may test him,” the Lord said to Satan. “Do whatever you want with everything he possesses, but don’t harm him physically.” So Satan left the Lord’s presence.\n\n13 One day when Job’s sons and daughters were feasting at the oldest brother’s house, 14 a messenger arrived at Job’s home with this news: “Your oxen were plowing, with the donkeys feeding beside them, 15 when the Sabeans raided us. They stole all the animals and killed all the farmhands. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”\n\n16 While he was still speaking, another messenger arrived with this news: “The fire of God has fallen from heaven and burned up your sheep and all the shepherds. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”\n\n17 While he was still speaking, a third messenger arrived with this news: “Three bands of Chaldean raiders have stolen your camels and killed your servants. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”\n\n18 While he was still speaking, another messenger arrived with this news: “Your sons and daughters were feasting in their oldest brother’s home. 19 Suddenly, a powerful wind swept in from the wilderness and hit the house on all sides. The house collapsed, and all your children are dead. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”\n\n20 Job stood up and tore his robe in grief. Then he shaved his head and fell to the ground to worship. 21 He said,\n\n“I came naked from my mother’s womb,\n    and I will be naked when I leave.\nThe Lord gave me what I had,\n    and the Lord has taken it away.\nPraise the name of the Lord!”\n\n22 In all of this, Job did not sin by blaming God.\n\nFootnotes\n1:6a Hebrew the sons of God.\n1:6b Hebrew and the satan; similarly throughout this chapter.", :number "1", :title "Job 1", :translation "NLT", :book "Job"} {:text "Elihu Accuses Job of Arrogance\n\n34 Then Elihu said:\n\n2 \n“Listen to me, you wise men.\n    Pay attention, you who have knowledge.\n\n3 \nJob said, ‘The ear tests the words it hears\n    just as the mouth distinguishes between foods.’\n\n4 \nSo let us discern for ourselves what is right;\n    let us learn together what is good.\n\n5 \nFor Job also said, ‘I am innocent,\n    but God has taken away my rights.\n\n6 \nI am innocent, but they call me a liar.\n    My suffering is incurable, though I have not sinned.’\n\n7 \n“Tell me, has there ever been a man like Job,\n    with his thirst for irreverent talk?\n\n8 \nHe chooses evil people as companions.\n    He spends his time with wicked men.\n\n9 \nHe has even said, ‘Why waste time\n    trying to please God?’\n\n10 \n“Listen to me, you who have understanding.\n    Everyone knows that God doesn’t sin!\n    The Almighty can do no wrong.\n\n11 \nHe repays people according to their deeds.\n    He treats people as they deserve.\n\n12 \nTruly, God will not do wrong.\n    The Almighty will not twist justice.\n\n13 \nDid someone else put the world in his care?\n    Who set the whole world in place?\n\n14 \nIf God were to take back his spirit\n    and withdraw his breath,\n\n15 \nall life would cease,\n    and humanity would turn again to dust.\n\n16 \n“Now listen to me if you are wise.\n    Pay attention to what I say.\n\n17 \nCould God govern if he hated justice?\n    Are you going to condemn the almighty judge?\n\n18 \nFor he says to kings, ‘You are wicked,’\n    and to nobles, ‘You are unjust.’\n\n19 \nHe doesn’t care how great a person may be,\n    and he pays no more attention to the rich than to the poor.\n    He made them all.\n\n20 \nIn a moment they die.\n    In the middle of the night they pass away;\n    the mighty are removed without human hand.\n\n21 \n“For God watches how people live;\n    he sees everything they do.\n\n22 \nNo darkness is thick enough\n    to hide the wicked from his eyes.\n\n23 \nWe don’t set the time\n    when we will come before God in judgment.\n\n24 \nHe brings the mighty to ruin without asking anyone,\n    and he sets up others in their place.\n\n25 \nHe knows what they do,\n    and in the night he overturns and destroys them.\n\n26 \nHe strikes them down because they are wicked,\n    doing it openly for all to see.\n\n27 \nFor they turned away from following him.\n    They have no respect for any of his ways.\n\n28 \nThey cause the poor to cry out, catching God’s attention.\n    He hears the cries of the needy.\n\n29 \nBut if he chooses to remain quiet,\n    who can criticize him?\nWhen he hides his face, no one can find him,\n    whether an individual or a nation.\n\n30 \nHe prevents the godless from ruling\n    so they cannot be a snare to the people.\n\n31 \n“Why don’t people say to God, ‘I have sinned,\n    but I will sin no more’?\n\n32 \nOr ‘I don’t know what evil I have done—tell me.\n    If I have done wrong, I will stop at once’?\n\n33 \n“Must God tailor his justice to your demands?\n    But you have rejected him!\nThe choice is yours, not mine.\n    Go ahead, share your wisdom with us.\n\n34 \nAfter all, bright people will tell me,\n    and wise people will hear me say,\n\n35 \n‘Job speaks out of ignorance;\n    his words lack insight.’\n\n36 \nJob, you deserve the maximum penalty\n    for the wicked way you have talked.\n\n37 \nFor you have added rebellion to your sin;\n    you show no respect,\n    and you speak many angry words against God.”", :number "34", :title "Job 34", :translation "NLT", :book "Job"} {:text "Elihu Responds to Job’s Friends\n\n32 Job’s three friends refused to reply further to him because he kept insisting on his innocence.\n\n2 Then Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the clan of Ram, became angry.
