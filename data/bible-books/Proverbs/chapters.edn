I lack common sense.\n\n3 \nI have not mastered human wisdom,\n    nor do I know the Holy One.\n\n4 \nWho but God goes up to heaven and comes back down?\n    Who holds the wind in his fists?\nWho wraps up the oceans in his cloak?\n    Who has created the whole wide world?\nWhat is his name—and his son’s name?\n    Tell me if you know!\n\n5 \nEvery word of God proves true.\n    He is a shield to all who come to him for protection.\n\n6 \nDo not add to his words,\n    or he may rebuke you and expose you as a liar.\n\n7 \nO God, I beg two favors from you;\n    let me have them before I die.\n\n8 \nFirst, help me never to tell a lie.\n    Second, give me neither poverty nor riches!\n    Give me just enough to satisfy my needs.\n\n9 \nFor if I grow rich, I may deny you and say, “Who is the Lord?”\n    And if I am too poor, I may steal and thus insult God’s holy name.\n\n10 \nNever slander a worker to the employer,\n    or the person will curse you, and you will pay for it.\n\n11 \nSome people curse their father\n    and do not thank their mother.\n\n12 \nThey are pure in their own eyes,\n    but they are filthy and unwashed.\n\n13 \nThey look proudly around,\n    casting disdainful glances.\n\n14 \nThey have teeth like swords\n    and fangs like knives.\nThey devour the poor from the earth\n    and the needy from among humanity.\n\n15 \nThe leech has two suckers\n    that cry out, “More, more!”[c]\n\nThere are three things that are never satisfied—\n    no, four that never say, “Enough!”:\n\n16 \nthe grave,[d]\n    the barren womb,\n    the thirsty desert,\n    the blazing fire.\n\n17 \nThe eye that mocks a father\n    and despises a mother’s instructions\nwill be plucked out by ravens of the valley\n    and eaten by vultures.\n\n18 \nThere are three things that amaze me—\n    no, four things that I don’t understand:\n\n19 \nhow an eagle glides through the sky,\n    how a snake slithers on a rock,\n    how a ship navigates the ocean,\n    how a man loves a woman.\n\n20 \nAn adulterous woman consumes a man,\n    then wipes her mouth and says, “What’s wrong with that?”\n\n21 \nThere are three things that make the earth tremble—\n    no, four it cannot endure:\n\n22 \na slave who becomes a king,\n    an overbearing fool who prospers,\n\n23 \n    a bitter woman who finally gets a husband,\n    a servant girl who supplants her mistress.\n\n24 \nThere are four things on earth that are small but unusually wise:\n\n25 \nAnts—they aren’t strong,\n    but they store up food all summer.\n\n26 \nHyraxes[e]—they aren’t powerful,\n    but they make their homes among the rocks.\n\n27 \nLocusts—they have no king,\n    but they march in formation.\n\n28 \nLizards—they are easy to catch,\n    but they are found even in kings’ palaces.\n\n29 \nThere are three things that walk with stately stride—\n    no, four that strut about:\n\n30 \nthe lion, king of animals, who won’t turn aside for anything,\n\n31 \n    the strutting rooster,\n    the male goat,\n    a king as he leads his army.\n\n32 \nIf you have been a fool by being proud or plotting evil,\n    cover your mouth in shame.\n\n33 \nAs the beating of cream yields butter\n    and striking the nose causes bleeding,\n    so stirring up anger causes quarrels.\n\nFootnotes\n30:1a Or son of Jakeh from Massa; or son of
