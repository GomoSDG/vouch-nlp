gather together,\n    you shameless nation.\n\n2 \nGather before judgment begins,\n    before your time to repent is blown away like chaff.\nAct now, before the fierce fury of the Lord falls\n    and the terrible day of the Lord’s anger begins.\n\n3 \nSeek the Lord, all who are humble,\n    and follow his commands.\nSeek to do what is right\n    and to live humbly.\nPerhaps even yet the Lord will protect you—\n    protect you from his anger on that day of destruction.\n\nJudgment against Philistia\n\n4 \nGaza and Ashkelon will be abandoned,\n    Ashdod and Ekron torn down.\n\n5 \nAnd what sorrow awaits you Philistines[a]\n    who live along the coast and in the land of Canaan,\n    for this judgment is against you, too!\nThe Lord will destroy you\n    until not one of you is left.\n\n6 \nThe Philistine coast will become a wilderness pasture,\n    a place of shepherd camps\n    and enclosures for sheep and goats.\n\n7 \nThe remnant of the tribe of Judah will pasture there.\n    They will rest at night in the abandoned houses in Ashkelon.\nFor the Lord their God will visit his people in kindness\n    and restore their prosperity again.\n\nJudgment against Moab and Ammon\n\n8 \n“I have heard the taunts of the Moabites\n    and the insults of the Ammonites,\nmocking my people\n    and invading their borders.\n\n9 \nNow, as surely as I live,”\n    says the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel,\n“Moab and Ammon will be destroyed—\n    destroyed as completely as Sodom and Gomorrah.\nTheir land will become a place of stinging nettles,\n    salt pits, and eternal desolation.\nThe remnant of my people will plunder them\n    and take their land.”\n\n10 \nThey will receive the wages of their pride,\n    for they have scoffed at the people of the Lord of Heaven’s Armies.\n\n11 \nThe Lord will terrify them\n    as he destroys all the gods in the land.\nThen nations around the world will worship the Lord,\n    each in their own land.\n\nJudgment against Ethiopia and Assyria\n\n12 \n“You Ethiopians[b] will also be slaughtered\n    by my sword,” says the Lord.\n\n13 \nAnd the Lord will strike the lands of the north with his fist,\n    destroying the land of Assyria.\nHe will make its great capital, Nineveh, a desolate wasteland,\n    parched like a desert.\n\n14 \nThe proud city will become a pasture for flocks and herds,\n    and all sorts of wild animals will settle there.\nThe desert owl and screech owl will roost on its ruined columns,\n    their calls echoing through the gaping windows.\nRubble will block all the doorways,\n    and the cedar paneling will be exposed to the weather.\n\n15 \nThis is the boisterous city,\n    once so secure.\n“I am the greatest!” it boasted.\n    “No other city can compare with me!”\nBut now, look how
